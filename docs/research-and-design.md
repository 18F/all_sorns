# Research + Design

## Research Synthesis

We have been doing research with privacy professionals in government
throughout development of SORN DASH. Gathering feedback from
professional users has been a fundamental part of the process of
development, and should be an integral part of any future development
efforts. Further research is needed with members of the public who might
use SORN DASH in the process of making Privacy Act requests for their
own records.

Summaries and synthesis of our research results from each phase are
