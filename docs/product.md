## Roadmap

Our roadmap is
[<span class="underline">here</span>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11pDStn-mIJMQlJ2mCLivXTSRRgF_7Rgilb2_BmjSWmA/edit#heading=h.d2xjq6zdpwq).
We’ve updated it to reflect the state of the project and the
opportunities for further improvement and new features that could be
added. Additionally, we’ve added issues in the github repository to
include a few known bugs and issues that we did not have time to
address.
